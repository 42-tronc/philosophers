Need to check for the args
	number_of_philosophers
	time_to_die
	time_to_eat
	time_to_sleep

	- number_of_philosophers: The number of philosophers and also the number of forks.
	- time_to_die (in milliseconds): If a philosopher didnâ€™t start eating time_to_die
	milliseconds since the beginning of their last meal or the beginning of the simulation, they die.
	- time_to_eat (in milliseconds): The time it takes for a philosopher to eat.
	During that time, they will need to hold two forks.
	- time_to_sleep (in milliseconds): The time a philosopher will spend sleeping.
	- number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat (optional argument): If all
	philosophers have eaten at least number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat
	times, the simulation stops. If not specified, the simulation stops when a
	philosopher dies.

Allowed functions:
	memset, printf, malloc, free, write,
